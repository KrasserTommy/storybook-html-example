# Storybook Example for HTML

This repo has two button examples for a Storybook component library.

1. Example of a simple button which shows the CSS styles and the HTML in the `HTML`-Tab of Storybook. This show all code from the HTML-file, including the example Styles. But it isn't possible to use the controls.
2. The out of the box example by Storybook. It generates an HTML component with JS, but this allows to control the button with changing properties in the Storybook Controls.

## Run Storybook

Run storybook with:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
